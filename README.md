## The Corpse And Excuisite

A Poem by Anon
--------------

> Whose Excuisite is that? I think I know. Its owner is quite happy though. Full of joy like a vivid rainbow, I watch her laugh. I cry hello.

> She gives her Excuisite a shake, And laughs until her belly aches. The only other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.

> The Excuisite is corpse, and deep, But she has promises to keep, After cake and lots of sleep. Sweet dreams come to her cheap.

> She rises from her gentle bed, With thoughts of kittens in her head, She eats her jam with lots of bread. Ready for the day ahead.
